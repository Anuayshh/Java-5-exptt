# Java-5-exptt
# Aim:
To write a Java program to create an object outside the main class.

# Algorithm
Step 1 : Open Intelli J application or any other code editor.

Step 2 : Create a class called "Employee" and create required statements.

Step 3 : Create a main class,called the "Solution".

Step 4 : Using the 'extends' keyword you can inherit classes, do the same with above created class.

Step 5 : Display the statements from the first and secomd Class using Solution Class in the terminal.

# Program
<br> public class Employee
<br>{
<br> public void display(){
    System.out.println("Name"+"\t"+"Year Of Joining"+"\t\t"+"Address");
    }
    public void employee(String name,int year,String Sal,String address)
    {
        System.out.println(name+"\t\t"+year+"\t\t"+address);

    }
}
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Employee emp1=new Employee();
        Employee emp2=new Employee();
        Employee emp3=new Employee();
        emp1.display();
        emp1.employee("Robert",1994,"50k","64C-WallStreet");
        emp2.employee("Sam  ",2000,"50k","68D-WallStreet");
        emp3.employee("John",1999,"50k","26B-WallStreet");
    }
}
# Output

# Result
We have successfully created a Java program to create an object outside the main class.
